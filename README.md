# tourcanada
Developed a personal project that shows tourism information of each province in Canada. Users can click on the tour sights shown as numbers on each province layer. Stored each tourism information, including picture, description, url, address, longitude and latitude in GeoJSON, and used that to put markers on the map; and also imported MarkerCluster api to prevent markers from being overlapped. Used HTML, CSS, Javascript, GeoJSON, and Mapbox API.
